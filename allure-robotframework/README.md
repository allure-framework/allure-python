## Installation and Usage

```shell
$ pip install allure-robotframework
$ robot --listener allure_robotframework ./my_robot_test
```

The default output directory is `output/allure`.
Use the listener's argument to change it:

```shell
$ robot --listener allure_robotframework:/set/your/path/here ./my_robot_test
```

The listener supports [the robotframework-pabot library](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/robotframework-pabot):

```shell
$ pabot --listener allure_robotframework ./my_robot_test
```

The advanced listener settings:

  - ALLURE_MAX_STEP_MESSAGE_COUNT=5. If a robotframework step contains less
    messages than has been specified by this setting, each message is shown as a substep.
    This reduces the number of attachments in large projects. The default value
    is zero - all messages are displayed as attachments.

### Usage examples

See the usage examples [here](https://github.com/allure-framework/allure-python/tree/master/allure-robotframework/examples).
